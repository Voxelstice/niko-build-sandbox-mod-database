# niko-build-sandbox-mod-database
A github repo as an database of verified mods for nikothegamer100's building sandbox game mods

### But why? Cant you just make it so anyone can load mods?
People simply can just put malicious stuff, so it's best to have an verification process. Updating the mod will make the mod unverified, just so you don't put malicious code right after it gets verified.

### How do I submit my mod?
<!--It's simple, issues in this repo are open for an reason. Simply make a issue in [this form.](https://github.com/Voxelstice/niko-build-sandbox-mod-database/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=mod-submission.yml&title=%5BMod+submission%5D%3A+)

Before you submit your mod, please follow the rules from [this issue.](https://github.com/Voxelstice/niko-build-sandbox-mod-database/issues/2)

### How do I make a mod?
The End.-->
Since `IDK`, submitting mods as github issues is no longer recommended. [Please join the discord server instead.](https://www.roblox.com/games/11035349204/Building-Sandbox-0-3)

Before you ask on why it redirects you to the roblox game, you have to join the discord via the social media links. This is to (try) prevent underage users just finding this github repo and just joining the discord from there.
