# niko-build-sandbox-mod-database
A github repo as an database of verified mods for nikothegamer100's building sandbox game mods


### But why? Cant you just make it so anyone can load mods?
People simply can just put malicious stuff, so it's best to have an verification process.

### How do I get my mod verified?
Your mod **SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY** malicious stuff in it. Any kind of malicious stuff is __not prohibited__ and will result in instant deny of your mod.

### How do I upload a mod request?

It is quite easy, please refer to https://github.com/Voxelstice/niko-build-sandbox-mod-database/issues and upload your mod there in this format.

There you should find template mod submission.

### How do i make a mod?
First of all, make a ModuleScript and name it "MainModule".
