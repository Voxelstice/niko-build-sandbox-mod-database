# niko-build-sandbox-mod-database
This github repo is the database for verified mods in nikothegamer100's building sandbox game.

### But why? Cant you just make it so anyone can load mods?
People simply can just put malicious stuff, so it's best to have a verification process. Updating the mod to Roblox will make the it "Out of date" as the game will use the version you submitted, just so you can't put malicious code right after it gets verified.
However, you *can* add a local mod (with dev mode enabled) which will load a mod id you provided to test your mod. This feature is only available in private servers.

<!--### How do I submit my mod?-->
<!--It's simple, issues in this repo are open for an reason. Simply make a issue in [this form.](https://github.com/Voxelstice/niko-build-sandbox-mod-database/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=mod-submission.yml&title=%5BMod+submission%5D%3A+)

Before you submit your mod, please follow the rules from [this issue.](https://github.com/Voxelstice/niko-build-sandbox-mod-database/issues/2)

### How do I make a mod?
The End.-->
<!--Since `IDK`, submitting mods as github issues is no longer recommended. [Please join the discord server instead.](https://www.roblox.com/games/11035349204/Building-Sandbox-0-3)-->
## Mod making info

### How do I make a mod?
To create your own mod, please join [our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/fuj3XvRjwX) and follow the instructions in #mod-instructions. You will have to use a rbxm as a template to start. Use the documentation located in `TBD` to use the game API.
You can test your mod locally to playtest and fix issues in a private server with dev mod enabled.

### How can I submit my mod for others to use?
First of all, make sure you are [our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/fuj3XvRjwX). Then you can fill out this form (TBD) and wait to be pinged in #mod-submission-results.
Your code will be checked and eventually be added in this database if your mod passes all the safety checks.
